hi welcome to "my" branch (aka the branch where i add stuff under kevins strict supervision so as not to break stuff)

what we dun and did:

NEW FILTERS: 
PopSize
Coal/Elec Ratio
SuiCo (Suicide Coefficient - EHP/Damage)
Build Time

NEW CHECKBOXES:
Land Only
Amphib Only
Water Only
Air Only

UI:
Made buttons smaller (so we can fit more filters on easily)
Added Reset Filter button for active filters

PLANS:
Add decimal values for damage, distance, suico and popsize.
Add filters for:
	Nandidd Efficiency Rating: (Damage*EHP)/(Coal+Elec)
	Ranged Potential: Ranged Damage * Ranged Distance
	Ranged Critical Mass Value: Ranged X * Build time (I'm unsure yet if I should use Ranged Potential or Ranged Damage for this value)
Add Hover-over tool tips for buttons for a description of the filter.


If you want any filter added, like the above listed, please hit me up. I might not get to it straight away but I'll add it to my list.

Thank Blother for all the hard work he's put into this app. This app is magnificent.
