Notes...
	Stats round down
		not pop size
	for..in over a table needs to use pairs() funciton
	HornNegateFull vs. NegateArmour
	LuaHandler causes the giant memory issues

	WHAT IS UP WITH ROUNDING IN LUA?
	
Bugs:

Attrcombiner.lua changes:
	"Autodefense" -> "AutoDefense"
	Removed "function combine_creature()" and the "end" at the bottom of the file
	Using the pairs() function in for loops
	setgameattribute("Power", power)

Other .lua changes:
	Removed spitting_spider.lua since Tellurian uses the spider.lua file for Spitting Spider





Lua Handler

	gets limb attributes
	other lua stuff...

Creature Combiner
	combine 2 creatures together to get all possible combinations between them
