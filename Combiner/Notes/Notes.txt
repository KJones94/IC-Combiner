Next steps:



determine health/defense formula for body parts

combine limbattributes from both stock animals into one
	- choose head, torso, damage, etc. based on which limb is used
		- can just use in calculations, like for armour and health
	- grab all abilities, but set active based on limb
	- might need lua table to do this

run creatures through attrcombiner to get final stats and costs
	- getgameattribute
	- setgameattribute
	- min
	- max

create XAML display for creatures


TODO:
	Allow all body parts the ability to contribute to stats if added to stock luas at a later date
	Exception catching for limb attributes accessing
