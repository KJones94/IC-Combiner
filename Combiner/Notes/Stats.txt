armour = armour * .8

take largest size

size_diff = larger size / smaller size
health = size_diff ^ exp_hitpoint * hitpoints

water speed = (larger_size - smaller_size) * (-1) * exp_speed * speed + 1

or maybe this... water speed = (larger_size / smaller_size) ^ (exp_speed_max + waterspeed_exp) * speed


damage and speed_max same as health formula
