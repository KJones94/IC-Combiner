Power = (health / (1 - armour)) ^ (.63) * (.19 * damage + 2.56)

armour = armour * .8

take largest size

size_diff = larger size / smaller size
health = size_diff ^ exp_hitpoint * hitpoints

[Not this...] water speed = (larger_size - smaller_size) * (-1) * exp_speed * speed + 1

or maybe this... water speed = (larger_size / smaller_size) ^ (exp_speed_max + waterspeed_exp) * speed
Airspeed could be the same as ^
Could it be (larger_size - 1)??

damage and speed_max same as health formula
